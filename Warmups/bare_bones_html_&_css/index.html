    <h1>Welcome to the Bare Bones HTML &amp; CSS</h1>
    
    <p>This paragraph is essentially useless. It's just to practice HTML and CSS. I want to see if I just copy and paste this entire paragraph if I can get them to be side by side. I want it to look like columns and not rows. Let's see how it looks. Hopefully it looks really good.</p>
