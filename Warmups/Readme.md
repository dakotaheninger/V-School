# Warmups
<p>The Warmups section is compiled of small assignments given each morning to get us thinking! Mostly Javascript, but also some small HTML and CSS warmups! Unlike Exercises, Warmups is not designed to go in depth on a new topic, but rather to start the day writing code and get our minds in the right state!</p>
